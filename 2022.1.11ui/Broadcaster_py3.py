# File Name: Broadcaster.py
# Purpose: Broadcaster is a class which allows multiple clients to connect to a TCP socket and
#  receive data which is broadcasted to all of them. A client may disconnect at any time without
#  affecting the other clients.
#
# Notes:
#
# File History:
# 05-??-?? sze   Created file
# 05-12-04 sze   Added this header
# 06-03-10 sze   Removed assert statements
# 07-09-06 sze   Introduced safeLog function
# 08-03-05 sze   Return queue length during put to message Queue
# 08-04-23 sze   Ensure that listen socket is closed when broadcaster thread stops
# 09-10-23 sze   Simplified to do queuing in kernel
# 14-06-29 sze   Use 0MQ PUB-SUB protocol instead of TCP Sockets
